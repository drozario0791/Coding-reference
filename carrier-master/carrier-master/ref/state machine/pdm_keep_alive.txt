Hello Support,

The reference manual states:

The PDM expects to receive commands from a controlling device every
second. If a CAN command message is not received, the PDM assumes that
the CAN bus is faulted and goes into a Loss of Communication mode.

Which CAN messages are valid to send to keep the PDM from entering
into Loss of Communication mode? Does the message have to be a Command
Output Channel command or will the sending of some other message
prevent entering into a Loss of Communication mode? Is it possible to
temporally disable the Loss of Communication mode feature?

I ask because there are times when we will need to debug our system
controller, which is sending the CAN messages, by using a JTAG
debugger to single-step through source code. During single-step
debugging with the JTAG, CAN messages are not being sent every second.

Regards,
Tom Wilson

Hello,

Any CAN traffic will be enough to keep the PDM from entering loss of
communication mode, you could simply create a 'junk' message with no
value and send to maintain the connection.  unfortunately it is not
possible to disable the loss of communication mode, as this safeguard
is currently the only one present against loss of CAN data.
